# DeepNN2048

## This is the code for my independent study project in Deep Neural Network, Fall 2017.

The project is written in Python 3 using the Keras library for building the neural network model. The model is trained and validated using an
AI agent that I developed earlier. This AI agent applied the minimax algorithm with some heuristics to win the 2048 game. Using this version, I
have generated 1000 games for the Neural Network to be trained on, and about 100 games to validate the network. The current model has the accuracy of 70%, making it achieve 1024 for 60% of the time.

In order to run the visuallization, please cd to /gameplay and run this command:

```
python3 GameManager_3.py
```
